/**
 * âž• Add Two Numbers Represented as Linked Lists
 * ----------------------------------------------
 * Given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers,
 * where each node contains a single digit and the digits are stored in **reverse order**,
 * add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.
 *
 * ðŸ“Œ Constraints:
 * - The two input numbers are stored in reverse order.
 * - Each node contains a single digit (0â€“9).
 * - You must return the sum as a linked list in the same reverse format.
 * - You may assume there are no leading zeros (except for the number 0 itself).
 *
 * ðŸ§  Approach:
 * - Initialize a dummy node to act as the result list head.
 * - Use a `carry` variable to track overflow (i.e., when sum â‰¥ 10).
 * - Traverse both `l1` and `l2` simultaneously:
 *     - Add digits from both lists (or 0 if one list is shorter) + carry.
 *     - Compute `sum % 10` for the new node value.
 *     - Update carry as `Math.floor(sum / 10)`.
 * - At the end, if `carry` is non-zero, add an extra node.
 *
 * ðŸ“¦ Time Complexity: O(max(m, n)) â€” where m and n are lengths of l1 and l2
 * ðŸ“¦ Space Complexity: O(max(m, n)) â€” for the result list
 *
 * ðŸ§ª Example:
 * Input:
 *   l1: 2 â†’ 4 â†’ 3  (represents 342)
 *   l2: 5 â†’ 6 â†’ 4  (represents 465)
 *
 * Output:
 *   7 â†’ 0 â†’ 8      (represents 807 = 342 + 465)
